# **CY-METEO**

#### **--DESCRIPTION--**

CY-METEO is a program designed to produce graphics from meteorological measurements, such as temperature, pressure, wind, height, moisture, in French regions of the world.  
It was made in C and script shell. What we used to make graphs is GNUPLOT.  
The program awaits a command from the user to start filtering data from a meteorological file. Using C functions, it then sorts the data in specific ways in order to allow gnuplot to produce the graphs.  
The data can be filtered depending on time and regions, and the order of the sorts reversed. Three sorting modes are also available.  
  
  
#### **--HOW TO USE--**

1.  Download our files from this repository on your computer and put them in a directory of your choosing.
2.  Inside your terminal, enter that directory.  
3.  Put your data file inside ./C/data/ (or use the one we furnish on this repository, meteo_short.csv).
4.  Use the command "bash script.sh" with the options of your choice to start creating graphics ! 
    Warning : some options must be used.
    If you have any question about how to use CY-METEO, use the following command : "bash script.sh --help"
5.  If you have chosen multiple options, you will be able to see the graphs one at a time. To go on to the next one, simply close the current gnuplot window.
6.  Type "make clean" in your terminal to delete all our executables / object files if you don't want them.
7.  Have fun !


#### **--LIST OF OPTIONS--**

-f : serves to specify the path to the meteorological data file. Not using it will cause an error.

--avl : data is sorted by using AVL trees. If no sorting mode is specified, this is the default mode.

--abr : data is sorted by using ABR/BST trees.

--tab : data is sorted by using lists.

--help : puts a help message on the terminal.

-r : the sorts will be reversed (ascending becomes descending and descending becomes ascending).

-t : the program will produce graphics on temperature in French regions.  
You need to specify a mode as an argument.  
Use -t 1 to get average, minimum and maximum temperature for each station.  
Use -t 2 to get worldly average temperatures for each date and time.  
Use -t 3 to get temperature measurements for each station, date and time.  

-p : the program will produce graphics on pressure in French regions.  
You need to specify a mode as an argument.   
Use -p 1 to get average, minimum and maximum pressure for each station.  
Use -p 2 to get worldly average pressure measurements for each date and time.  
Use -p 3 to get pressure measurements for each station, date and time.  

-w : the program will produce graphics on wind in French regions.
The output will be a vector map representing average wind measurements in each region of the world.

-h : the program will produce graphics on the height of meteorological stations in French regions.
The output will be a map with colors representing heights in each region.

-m : the program will produce graphics on moisture levels in French regions.
The output will be a map with colors representing moisture levels in each region.

-d : allows to specify a time interval from which the data used will come.
 The format of the time interval is "YYYY-MM-DDYYYY-MM-DD".

-F : the data used will only be from the stations located in metropolitan France and Corsa.

-G : the data used will only be from stations located in French Guiana.

-A : the data used will only be from stations located in the West Indies.

-S: the data used will only be from the meteorological station of St-Pierre et Miquelon.

-Q: the data used will only be from stations located in Antarctica.

-O : the data used will only be from stations located in the Indian Ocean.

Please note that :  
Using -f is mandatory to allow the program to get the path to the data file.  
Using at least one option between -t -p -w -h -m is mandatory.  
A mode always needs to be specified with -t and -p.  
You can't use two modes of the same option in one command.  
Using two options or more for the place is not possible (-F -G -A -S -Q -O).  

Also, since during testing we have found the program to take quite a long time to execute with the original meteorological file, we have put a shortened version of this file containing the first 50 000 lines in ./C/data/  

#### **--INPUT FILE--**  

The input file is a CSV meteorological data file, with separator ";"  
Every line corresponds to a measurement made by a station at a given time.  
15 fields are used to provide informations and describe various aspects of the weather :  

The fields are as follow :  

Field 1 : Station ID                              // 5 figure number  
Field 2 : Date                                        // datetime format : 2010-01-05T10:00:00+01:00 (str)  
Field 3 : Pressure at sea level                      // Pa (int)  
Field 4 : Average wind orientation over 10 min         // degrees (int)  
Field 5 : Average wind speed over 10 min           // m/s (float)  
Field 6 : Moisture                                    // % (int)  
Field 7 : Pressure                            // Pa (float)  
Field 8 : Pressure variation over 24 hours          // Pa (float)  
Field 9 : Precipitations in the last 24 hours // mm (float)  
Field 10 : Coordinates                                // (float),(float)   
Field 11 : Temperature                                // °C (float)  
Field 12 : Minimal temperature over 24 hours         // °C (float)  
Field 13 : Maximal temperature over 24 hours         // °C (float)  
Field 14 : Height                                   // m (int)  
Field 15 : City's postcode when there is one            // (str)  

Note : In some cases, data is missing on a line and nothing is written in certain fields. In this situation, if this data is needed for one option, the program will simply ignore this line.
